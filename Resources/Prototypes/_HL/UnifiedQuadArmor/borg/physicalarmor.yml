# Borg Armor. For convenience sake; is also stored with their inventory.
# KEEP IN MIND IF THESE STATS LOOK STRONG; BORGS ONLY HAVE "TWO" LIMBS AND DO NOT DISTRIBUTE DAMAGE WHEN SHOT, MEANING THAT THEY EFFECTIVELY ONLY HAVE ONE PIECE OF ARMOR THAT DOESNT STACK
# SUBJECT TO HEAVY BALANCING
# Explosion resistance must be way higher because of this too, else borgs will become lego.
