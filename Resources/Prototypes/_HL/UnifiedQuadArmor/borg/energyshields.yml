  description: Light, thin plates, wired with a mixture of emitters and heavy power conduits. This armour is designed to sync to a synthetics power-cell, and allow for the projection of short-range shields. Due to the aftermarket nature of these modifications, they replace a synthetic's internal light mechanisms and switch.

  description: A heavier, chassis-mounted shield unit. Hooked directly into a synthetics power-cell, this one is more efficient at drawing charge, and projects a larger field, at the cost of movement capabilities due to the increased power draw. Due to the aftermarket nature of these modifications, they replace a synthetic's internal light mechanisms and switch.

  description: The Gold Standard in aftermarket synth-mounted shield projectors. A heavy, robust unit designed to project a high-energy field over a large zone. Typically used as a means of pacifying riots; this shield actively attempts to encompass foe and ally alike. Due to the aftermarket nature of these modifications, they replace a synthetic's internal light mechanisms and switch.
